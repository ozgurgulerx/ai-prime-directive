Think of a healthcare intake agent. It captures a referral, reads EHR notes and orders, checks eligibility and prior authorization with payers, assembles required documentation, schedules the patient, gets consents, sends reminders, and updates both the EHR and billing\u2014end to end. The value is a resolved intake: \u201cpatient scheduled with auth in place, docs filed, denial risk reduced.\u201d Agent does the whole work end-to-end delivering an outcome. Users don't live in the UI trying to push workflows forward. It is almost like a self-driving car that does the whole journey end-to-end (AI Agents) vs a navigation system in the car that only guides you (traditional software).</p> <p>Therefore AI Agents don't map into an incumbent product category. In order to grow business, you must do product discovery from inside the enterprise with domain experts as well as rapid prototyping with deployed engineers. </p> <p>FDE program isn\u2019t just a sales tactic; it\u2019s how you  1. Discover the real product,  2. Prove ROI fast, and finally  3. Convert that into bigger, outcome-priced contracts and reusable \u201cagent core\u201d IP.</p> <p>This is a two-role operating system: - Echo (embedded analysts / \u201cheretics\u201d): insiders who know the domain and want to change it. - Delta (deployed engineers): Prototype under pain &amp; time pressure; throwaway is acceptable.</p> <p>Other defining characteristics of an FDE program engagement are... - Contract value is continously pushed up by the FDE team uncovering more use-cases and value.  - Prototyping is used heavily to inspire or reveal \"real user desire\". </p> <p>Ultimately FDE is about doing things that don't scale and turning them into scalable methods and assets that you improve as you go along. e.g. applying the same assets and solutions in other customers. </p> <p>FDE talk from Bob McGrew (Check it out: FDE talk from Bob McGrew) really resonated with me as it aligns well with my earlier \"Frontier Labs\" initative at Microsoft Digital Natives org which was mostly about working with customer product as well as engineering managers to inspire them with quick but functional prototypes that demonstrate the potential and value with a product-led approach. </p> <ul> <li>Ozgur Istanbul, September 11th 2025</li> </ul>","tags":["semantic-kernel"]},{"location":"blog/2025/09/07/context-engineering/","title":"Context Engineering","text":"","tags":["RAG","data_integration_for_llms"]},{"location":"blog/2025/09/07/context-engineering/#context-engineering-what-it-is-why-it-matters","title":"Context Engineering - What it is? Why it matters?","text":"<p>Context is everything fed to the LLM during inference. This includes: - The instructions - a.k.a prompt - Retrieved facts (e.g. RAG, SQL queries, KG context, etc.) - History of the conversation (e.g. chat history) - Tool outputs (e.g. API responses)</p> <p>Context Engineering is simply how to get out of today's models by optimising the context, which includes all of the above. In practice it is everything that makes your agents better.</p> <p>Where prompt engineering is used to craft the instruction text, context engineering architects the whole information flow -data, tools, memory, ranking and budgets. On top of RAG, context engineering adds query planning, re-ranking, compression, memory and policy loops. So it includes both RAG and prompt-engineering and strives to build a system that optimises the context to generate the best llm outcome. </p> <p>Context Engineering - Core Tasks :</p> <ol> <li>Context retrieval / generation (RAG) </li> </ol> <p>Prompt based generation as well as external data integration using advanced models like agentic RAG and integration of Graph Data.</p> <ol> <li>Context processing </li> </ol> <p>(Skip this part if you are not building an LLM but using existing LLMs from frontier labs). </p> <p>This is mostly about choosing or training a model which will accomodate the length of the context as by definition LLMs have a fixed context length.

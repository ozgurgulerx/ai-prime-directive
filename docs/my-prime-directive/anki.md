# Anki Cards

High-signal flashcards for spaced repetition.

## Guidance

- Keep cards atomic; test one fact or pattern.  
- Prefer cloze deletions for concepts and code.  
- Tag by topic (e.g., `rag`, `evals`, `prompts`).

## Workflow

- Add cards as Markdown here or link decks exported from Anki.  
- Consider `anki-apkg-export` or `crowdanki` for versioning decks.

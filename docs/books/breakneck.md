## Why it matters
- When US companies offshored manufacturing to China, they didn’t just move factories—they exported tacit “process knowledge” that lives in people, supplier networks, and production routines, not just in blueprints.
- Dense manufacturing ecosystems (e.g., Shenzhen) compress iteration cycles and learning loops; proximity compounds capability.
- China’s state capacity is heavily influenced by engineers who prioritize tangible production over “financialization” and purely virtual markets.
- A strategy of “completionism” builds end‑to‑end, domestically contained supply chains, making industries sticky and resilient.
- In contrast, US institutional dominance by lawyers often adds procedural complexity and rent‑seeking, channeling power and resources upward while slowing real‑economy execution.

## Key takeaways
- Process knowledge is tacit: it is transmitted through co‑location, apprenticeship, and supplier relationships—not PDFs.
- Production is a learning system: every build yields feedback; learning loops close fastest near the factory.
- Ecosystems beat individuals: clusters like Shenzhen create community standards, shared parts bins, and a culture of engineering practice.
- Who governs shapes what gets built: engineers optimize for making; lawyers optimize for rules; financiers optimize for returns.
- Completionism is a moat: end‑to‑end capability reduces dependency risk and increases bargaining power.
- Implication for builders in the West: put teams closer to production, invest in manufacturing literacy, and shorten the design‑to‑factory feedback loop.

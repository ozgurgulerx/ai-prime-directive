### AI Ideation

_Intro (purpose, scope, audience)._

#### Problem framing
- What user/job are we targeting?
- Constraints, guardrails, and success metrics.

#### Idea generation
- Divergent exploration (personas, journeys, prompts, analogies).
- Tools and assets to leverage (data, APIs, models, agents).

#### Evaluation and selection
- Impact vs. effort matrix; risks (safety, privacy, reliability).
- Fast validation plan (prototype, evals, user tests).

#### Next steps
- Minimal viable artifact and milestones.
- Ownership and timeline.

_Add diagrams, examples, and links as needed._

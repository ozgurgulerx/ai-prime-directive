### Context Engineering - What it is? Why it matters? 

Context is everything fed to the LLM during inference. This includes:
- The instructions -the prompt
- Retrieved facts (e.g. with vector search)
- history of the conversation (e.g. chat history)
- tool outputs (e.g. API responses)

Where prompt engineering is used to craft the instruction text, context engineering architects the whole information flow -data, tools, memory, ranking and budgets.

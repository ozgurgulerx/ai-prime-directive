Below is from a presentation I delivered at the hub mapping AI paradigm shift's data requirements to Data.
Data narrative is mostly about unification and organization.

What I am really happy about is Microsoft embracing Graphs in GenAI context within Fabric to be able to build better AI products.

### Agentic AI

- Unify your Data
- Organize your Data
- Build data flywheels
- Agent Memory

### AI Assisted Coding

- Unified SDK
- Semantic Layer

### AI Security & Governance

- Unified Security Posture
- Unified Policy & Risk
- Lineage & Provenance

Microsoft Fabric Unifies your Data and Graph support organizes it by turning Data -> Knowledge.

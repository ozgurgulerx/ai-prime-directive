### CODEX Programming Best Practices 

!!! tip "Baseline workflow"
    Use a tight prompt–run–review loop to converge on working code quickly.
    
    1. Describe the intent and constraints clearly (inputs, outputs, tests).
    2. Ask for minimal code to pass the tests; run it; paste failures back in.
    3. Iterate until green; then ask for refactors with benchmarks.

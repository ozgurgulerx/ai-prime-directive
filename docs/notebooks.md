# Notebooks

Run-and-tweak Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning.

## Usage

- Add `.ipynb` files under `docs/` (or a subfolder); they render inline.  
- `.py` notebooks via Jupytext are also supported.

## Tips

- Keep notebooks focused (one topic per file).  
- Add a short preface cell on purpose and outcomes.  
- Prefer deterministic cells; mark long/remote cells as optional.
